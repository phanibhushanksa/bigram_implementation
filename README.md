# bigram_implementation
* This repo contains Implementation of a Bigram Language Model from scratch using Pytorch
* The names.txt contains appox ~32K names
* After creating a bigram model, we evaluate it using Negative Log Likelihood loss function
* In Part-2, we use a Neural Network to generate random names based on Initial input
* We see the comparision between the Probability model we created and the Neural Networks model
